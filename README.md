# Customer Bike Purchasing Dashboard

This project involves the creation of a dashboard based on a dataset containing information about potential customers and their likelihood of purchasing a bike. The dataset includes various demographic and behavioral attributes of the individuals.

## Data Cleaning and Analysis

The data was first cleaned because there were some errors. After cleaning the data, pivot tables were created to analyze the following aspects:

1. **Average Income Per Purchase**: A pivot table was created to analyze the average income of customers who made a bike purchase.

2. **Customer Age Brackets**: Another pivot table was established to categorize customers into different age brackets and analyze their distribution.

3. **Customer Commute**: A pivot table was set up to examine the commute distances of customers.

## Dashboard Visualizations

Three charts were created based on the pivot tables:

1. **Average Income Per Purchase Chart**: This chart displays the average income of customers who purchased a bike.

2. **Customer Age Brackets Chart**: It visualizes the distribution of customers across different age brackets.

3. **Customer Commute Chart**: This chart illustrates the commute distances of customers.

## Slicers

Slicers were added to provide interactivity to the dashboard:

1. **Region Slicer**: Allows users to filter data based on the region where customers reside.
2. **Education Slicer**: Enables filtering based on the education level of customers.
3. **Marital Status Slicer**: Allows filtering based on the marital status of customers.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Run the dashboard application.
3. Explore the visualizations and use slicers for interactive filtering.
